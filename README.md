# JavaOS
A medium-sized project designed to simulate a real operating system.


First things first, I would like to mention some important things.

* 1: This project was compiled with Java 11.

* 2: I used the free BlueJ IDE to compile this, here's a link: https://www.bluej.org/versions.html

* 3: This project may be Windows exclusive. I can't be 100% sure, since I only have a Windows computer, but just bear this in mind.


Now, what exactly is JavaOS?


JavaOS is a program that is designed to look and feel like a real OS. It contains several programs that can do some relatively useful things.


Most of the applications were not designed by me, so thank you to everyone who created the apps I used here.
